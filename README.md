UConn Full Stack Web Development Bootcamp Module 1 Challenge

Given a webpage that was already styled and met accessibility standards, I modified the code to make it easier to read and to make changes in the future.

Originally the HTML for this webpage did not contain many semantic elements so it was difficult to tell which parts of the HTML corresponded with which parts of the webpage. 
The CSS was repetitive and disorganized, so like in the HTML it was difficult to tell which parts of the CSS corresponded with which parts of the HTML and the webpage. 
I added semantic elements to the HTML to make it easier to read so if any structural changes need to made in the future, it will take less time. I reorganized the CSS to match the structure of the HTML and removed unnecessary repetitive code. 

To use this webpage either scroll down the page to read the different sections or click the links at the top of the page to jump to a specific section.
